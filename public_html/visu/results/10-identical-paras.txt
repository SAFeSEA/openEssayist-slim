There was once a frog who noticed an ox standing in the meadow. The frog was seized by a jealous desire to equal the ox in size so she puffed herself up, inflating her wrinkled skin. She then asked her children if she was now bigger than the ox. They said that she was not. Once again she filled herself full of air, straining even harder than before, and asked her children which of the two of them was bigger. “The ox is bigger,” said her children. The frog was finally so indignant that she tried even harder to puff herself up, but her body exploded and she fell down dead.
