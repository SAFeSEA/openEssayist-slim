CORRECTING  THE  BLACK-GAY  DISTINCTION IN  CURRENT  INTERPRETATIONS  OF  THE 
EQUAL  PROTECTION  CLAUSE 


Anthony Berryhill


f
ince  the  U.S. Supreme Court  decided Brown v.  Board of
Education in 1954, the African-American  experience of discrimination has served as the benchmark for groups  that  may warrant  civil rights  protection under the  Equal  Protection Clause of the  14th Amendment. Whether or  not  a victimized  group is eligible  for protection under the  Equal  Protection Clause and  what legal test will determine how much  cautionary protection that group is to be accorded, are  determined by the  analogy  of African-American experience. In recent years, the Supreme Court  and society at large have defined criteria  for protection that  essentially remove  homosexuals from protective consideration. When analyzing the specific standards used  to exclude homosexuals from  equal  protection, a legal case for the contrary  can be made  by showing that the criteria differentiating blacks and  gays are flawed, and  by demonstrating that  despite  important differences between  the  political  histories of the two groups,  there are relevant  similarities  in their  history of prejudice that  make the two groups’  experiences of discrimination synonymous  in the  eyes of the  law.
In terms of civil rights, the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment is the  Constitution’s guiding force:










This amendment has traditionally been  used  to address  specific issues of discrimination and  the  justifiability of including specific groups   of  people  for   and   excluding  others   from   judicially monitored protection. The  legal problem determines the  specific criteria  for when  and  how the  courts,  as interpreters of the  law, should  inter fere  in the  discriminatory practices  found in society at large. The  issue here  is whether or not,  and  to what extent the courts  should  protect gays from  discrimination as a matter of upholding their  rights  to “equal  protection” under the  laws. The law creates  special tests for determining the  extent that  the  courts should  respond to a particular type of discrimination under the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court  has established the example of  discrimination against  blacks  as the  benchmark and  prime analogy  for evaluating  the  extent to which the  Equal  Protection Clause  should  provide  protection to other groups.  As Geoffrey Stone  obser ves in Constitutional Law, “[T]he Court’s  analysis of discrimination against African Americans  has served as a prototype for the  development of other constitutional devices” (421).
For African Americans,  the  Court  has come  to apply a test of “strict scrutiny” to alleged  instances  of discrimination; it is a test which  places  a  maximum burden  on  the  defendant—“strictly scrutinizing” his actions—to demonstrate that  there were no racist intentions behind his act and  that  the  effect of discrimination was absolutely necessary to the achievement of some crucial  social goal. The  courts  have come  to protect African Americans  to this strict degree because  of several factors  relating to their  history  of and historical  vulnerability  to discrimination in this country:  first, that race  is immutable (“defined by genetics”); second,  that  African Americans  have experienced extreme social stereotyping (such  as “hyper-sexuality” and  “laziness”); and  finally, that historically  blacks have suffered  immense political and legal prejudice, which precluded their  ability to effect political  influence (Steffan  xvi). As such, race discrimination has become the example upon  which the Supreme Court  has developed its current criteria  for determining which social groups  will receive “strict scrutiny” protection under the  14th  Amendment. These  criteria  include:
1.  there must be a history of discrimination like the African American  experience
2.  the  nature of the  distinguishing trait  must be immutable and  beyond  one’s control
3.  either the minority  in question must be in a politically powerless position  or the right  in question must be  a fundamental right.  (High Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Office, 668 F. Supp.  1361, 1987)
Currently, homosexuals are given the polar  opposite degree of protection: that  is to say, virtually no protection under “strict scrutiny” because  their  cases of discrimination are determined by the “rational  basis test.” As the name  suggests, the test proceeds on the premise that  as long as a defendant can argue  a logical reason  or “rational  basis” for an action  that ultimately  (but  inadvertently) had a discriminatory effect, the Court  will allow the defendant’s actions to stand.  Hence, one  can see why so much  depends on the  type of test and  the degree to which the court  will apply an analogy to the African-American  experience: i.e., in almost every case, the choice of test, which is dependent upon  the  degree to which the  analogy applies,  determines the outcome of the review and  whether or not protection is provided. Essentially, saying that  gays are protected under the Equal Protection Clause but only under the rational basis test is in reality, no  protection at all.
For example, the rational basis test has been  used in cases such as the  military’s “don’t  ask, don’t  tell policy” as well as in Bowers v. Hardwick (1986),   where  the  Court  argued, “[I]t  is rational to criminalize the conduct [of homosexuality]. . . it is rational to deny special favor and  protection to those  with a self-avowed tendency to engage  in [homosexual] conduct” (Bowers, 478 U.S. 186, 646). Therefore, the  cause  to  protect  homosexuals requires a  legal argument that  either meets  the  three criteria  in High Tech Gays (analogizing blacks and  gays as social groups) or one  that  rejects the  premises  of the  Bowers v. Hardwick decision  by showing  that homosexuals  have  fundamental rights  that  must  be  included under the 14th Amendment. This paper will argue  both  positions, using  direct  analogies  to  the  African  American  experience to establish  both  legal claims.
Of course,  in American  society, the  cause to give homosexuals equal  civil rights under the Equal Protection Clause raises tremendous  opposition. Opponents to equal  protection cite  the  three criteria  in High Tech Gays and  explain  point  by point,  why homosexuals and  blacks do not  have either the  same or a substantially similar history of discrimination. Surprisingly,  one group that shares this view is a particular segment  of the African-American  community itself. The  title of Eric Brandt’s  famous  study, Dangerous Liaisons, indicate the  competition that  blacks and  gays share  in the  goal to earn  legal civil rights. Brandt  explains  that he wrote his book in the context of a common conflict  between  the  two groups  concerning which is the more  oppressed. Whereas  gays claim they lack marriage rights  and  employment opportunities, blacks view an analogy  to their  experience as “offensive” and  the  history  of discrimination against gays as a far cry from the historical  experience of slavery (2).
In  fact,  the  current political  climate  feeds  this  adversarial attitude over civil rights,  and  thus the  African-American  response to equal  civil rights.  Today, many among  the  black leadership feel that  the political  climate  is inclined toward taking away civil rights protections by attacking  affirmative  action  while at the  same time, in cases such as Romer v. Evans (1995),  one finds the judiciary giving consideration to same-sex marriage, anti-discrimination laws in the workplace  and a new wave of civil rights (Brandt 5). In other words, many blacks view homosexual civil rights protection as a threat to their  own cause for social reform  as “rights frameworks  require us […]  to prove our  belonging by proving  […]  victimhood. [Blacks] gain ‘strict judicial scrutiny’ by establishing ourselves as a ‘special [discriminated] class’” (Segrest  55). Therefore, providing homosexuals protection equal  to that  of blacks means  that  blacks would be  legally less “special” and  would  have  a lower entitlement to special legal consideration and,  therefore, civil rights protection.
Ironically,  the  main  arguments made  by the  African-American leadership echo  the  sentiments of the  Supreme Court:  special interest groups  such as the NAACP and  the institution of the black church claim that  there is no relevant  link between  the  prejudices harbored against gays and  blacks. Opponents commonly  claim that gay and  black  experiences of discrimination are  not  identical. Whereas  blacks have  suffered  institutional slavery, extremes of violence  like lynching,  and  political  powerlessness  (to  the  extent of de jure denial  of voting rights), homosexuals have been  significantly immune from  such  history  (Smith  16).  The  attitude that opponents take (particularly among  the  African-American  leadership)  is that  gays want “special rights” and  that  giving them  equal coverage is an insult to the civil rights cause. Indeed, special-interest groups   deliberately  use  propaganda  to  convince   blacks  that anti-gay prejudice is not like race prejudice, just as movies like The Gay Agenda implicitly argue  that gays do not need  political  help  and that  they can change their  sexual orientation (Solomon 64).
In addition, opponents of equal  rights  focus on  the  immutability standard, claiming  that  homosexuals can choose  to opt out of their  homosexual behavior,  a trait that is not similar to the black experience wherein  such adaptation is impossible  (i.e.  skin color is virtually static).  As a group of Cleveland  black special-interest groups  have advertised  the matter: “[B]eing black is an ontological reality […] [whereas] homosexuality is a chosen  life style, defined by behavior”  (Smith  20).  Henry  Louis Gates elaborates, “[T]he repugnance that  many people feel toward  gays concerns […]  the status ascribed  to them.  . . .Disapproval  of a sexual practice is transmuted into  the  demonization of a sexual species” (qtd.  in Brandt 26-27). In other words, the way opponents of equal  rights view the issue, the  difference between  blacks and  gays is one  of behavior versus status: discrimination against  blacks associates a particular behavior  to blacks while gay discrimination labels its hatred toward the  status of the  whole group. The  courts  also adopt  this mindset when refusing  to allow equal  rights for homosexuals; and  this also is the  idea behind Clinton’s  “don’t  ask, don’t  tell” policy, wherein discrimination proves justifiable if one  demonstrates “homosexual” behavior  or otherwise  reveals one  is gay. As Lois Shawver notes, “Our  society has not  only made  it very dangerous to be a homosexual,  it has even made  it dangerous to look  like one,  associate with one,  or argue  in their  behalf”  (102-103).
Finally, opponents of equal  rights for homosexuals refer  to the third  criterion for 14th Amendment protection: political  powerlessness and  proof  that  a “fundamental right”  is at stake. Opponents often  claim that  gays have a large amount of political  influence in Congress  and  in society as a whole and  that  they also have a lot of political  clout  to  remedy  the  discrimination in  front  of them. Homosexuals are viewed as “uniformly  wealthy, highly privileged and politically powerful” (Smith  16). This view often  continues with claims that  gays have far more  economic advantages  than  African Americans,  partly  due  to the  ability to get jobs, promotions and opportunities without  necessarily  having  to deal  with prejudice. They “have it better,”  as Henry  Louis Gates elaborates, pointing to the higher average incomes  and  educational levels that  distinguish gays from blacks. While the national average salary is $32,144, gays enjoy an average of $55,430, while blacks have only $12,166. 59.6% of homosexuals, according to this Wall Street Journal report, attend college  compared to the  national average of 18% of blacks (WellsPetry 38). The  courts  have not  ignored this claim when  deciding against homosexual civil rights. Judge Oliver Hasch,  in his decision against protecting Joseph  Steffan from exclusion from the military (based  on his sexual orientation), argued that gays do not meet  the political  powerlessness  criterion because  they have political  clout in Congress  and  the ability to publicly rally for issues like AIDS and civil rights  (Steffan  180).
Indeed, many of these  claims against  homosexual civil rights seem accurate. There are indeed substantial differences between blacks and  gays economically and  politically. It is plausible  to think that  homosexuals “have it better”  in the  political  climate  and  that they  can  “change”  their   behavior   to  avoid  discrimination. By definition, the two types of discrimination are different: clearly, race and  sexual orientation are not identical traits, and  different social expectations are  attached to  each  concept. Henry  Louis  Gates points  out this difference as now society knows that  African-American  prejudice is wrong  and  legally unjustifiable, while prejudice against  gays is highly debatable and  subject  to discussion  (qtd.  in Brandt  28).
However, to reach  these  conclusions without  fully analyzing the logical fallacies of each, as current society and  the American  courts have  done,  is to  reach  a hasty conclusion. Although there are substantial differences between  blacks  and  gays, there are  also substantial structural similarities  to  these  groups’  histories  of discrimination that  justify both  groups  getting  protection under “strict scrutiny” because  the social methods of prejudice for blacks and  gays are  virtually identical.

I.    Violence based on prejudice
Although homosexuals have not suffered  centuries of institutional slavery, they have, like African Americans,  been  attacked in similar ways for their  differences. For example, violence  among  both groups  is steadily  increasing. Within  months of each  other, an African American  and a gay man were both  killed as a consequence of their  minority  status. On  June  7, 1998, James Byrd was beaten and  dragged by a truck  because  he was black. On  October 11th   of the  same  year,  Matthew  Shepard suffered   a  similar  fate  after several homophobic classmates convinced him that  they were gay and  beat  him  to death. The  pattern of violence  is so similar  that violence  against  both  gays and  blacks is now covered  under the category  “hate crimes.” The differences in the histories  of discrimination are irrelevant as both  groups,  despite  their  differences, have increasing levels of hate  crime violence (Brandt 3-4). Barbara  Smith also makes  the  same  point—that past differences in blacks’ and gays’ histories  of discrimination are  irrelevant to the  social and physical violence that each group similarly suffers today—in  describing  how  gays are  “threatened with the  loss of employment, of housing […]  [child] custody and  are subject  to verbal abuse,  gay bashing,  and  death”  (16).
When comparing current societal discrimination against  gays and  the  violent reactions from  civil rights  protests  in the  50s and 60s, each  demonstrates similar  types of social outrage. Whereas blacks were sprayed with water hoses when fighting  for equal  rights and  labeled  with terms  such as “coon” and  the  “N-word,” gays are labeled  as “per verts,” child-molesters and  other terms.  In  both examples,  such  labeling  is designed to silence  the  target  groups from protesting their  minority  status as it provides society quick and convenient terms  that  require no discussion,  evidence  or analysis to justify. In fact, such labeling  makes opposition to such labeling impossible.  As Mab Segrest  agrees:







This social labeling  also extends to silencing  society at large from disagreeing with such social prejudice: just as supporters of black rights  were once  called  “nigger-sympathizers” in today’s society, supporters of gay rights are labeled  along with the minority  group as “gays” and  “queers.”
The  social implications of this labeling  manifest  themselves  in many homosexuals’ consistent fear for their  physical safety. In a case study of an anonymous Northeast college (called  “Clement University”), Robert  Rhoads  surveyed the  entire student body and  found that  54% of the  students felt that  homosexuals would be openly harassed on campus  for announcing their  sexual orientation. Even more  alarming, 33% of the straight  population at the college feared even associating  with homosexuals out of fear of being  labeled  as well (Rhoads 16).  Of  the  homosexual population  at  Clement University, all 2,074 people who testified  to being  homosexual in the  survey said they had  been  a target  of hate  crime  at some point in  their  lives because  of their  sexual  orientation (Rhoads 13). Clearly, in terms  of violence  there is a legal justification  for concluding  that  the  black and  gay histories  of discrimination are not the  same, but  now they are similar,  and  ought  to be treated so by the  14th  Amendment.
Just as all blacks have feared  for their  well-being when their  civil rights  have been  in question, homosexuals face that  same fear as they fight  for legal protection while fearing  the  current societal trend of treating systemic violence  against  gays as acceptable and not  as important as similar  violence  that  happened to blacks.

II.   Immutability is not an appropriate standard to justify excluding homosexuals from equal rights.
Probably  the  most difficult  commonly  advanced argument for gay rights   activists  to   refute   is  the   contention  that   while   race is immutable and  cannot be changed, homosexuality is a choice. The  truth of this contention is highly debatable and  beyond  the scope  of this paper;  however,  to question the  logic of using  such a standard is definitely  fair ground.
Immutability as a standard lacks internal logic. The courts  have accepted without  question the  claim that  only groups  with immutable  traits  merit  special  protection, and  have used  this claim of immutability as proof  that  prejudice against  blacks and  gays are distinct.  Ironically,  arbitrary  standards like immutability are key to perceiving  the structural similarity to prejudice against both  groups. In  the  African-American   experience, the  courts  have  allowed discrimination based  on grandfather clauses, literacy tests and  the “brown paper bag rule,” in which the proximity  of one’s skin color to a brown  paper bag determined one’s racial category  of black or white (Wright,  para. 15). There was also, at one time, the “one drop rule,” which dictated that an individual  of 1/16th black heritage was automatically  classified  as  black,  without   exception  (Wright, para.  15). Only recently  has the  idea  of being  “multiracial”  been accepted in lieu of the  strict “black and  white” mentality  of racist society. In the same way, gays have been  treated as a group defined and  identified by completely arbitrary  criteria.  For example, in the military’s “don’t ask, don’t  tell policy,” people can be excluded even if they are straight.  As Louis Fisher points  out, individuals  suspected of being  homosexual are arbitrarily  given the  burden of proof  to show that  “the member […]  demonstrates that  he or she is not  a person who engages  in, attempts to engage  in, has propensity to engage  in, or intends to engage  in homosexual acts” (1089).
Even worse, immutability as a standard deliberately reinforces the  same  level of inferiority  that  the  court  in Brown v. Board of Education explicitly rejects  (Richards 2). It is this legal and  social classification  that  both  blacks and  gays fight when they want equal rights.  Under both  forms  of discrimination, prejudice is legally justified  by “the construction of an American  identity.”  For gays, the  idea  of immutability makes them  out  to be unnatural, queer, lacking  moral  value and  to be subhuman. Similarly, blacks have faced these  same stereotypes as both  groups  are often  seen as “onedimensional”: as either “means of production” or “immoral  sexual creatures […]  interested mostly in sexual gratification” (Richards 5).  Therefore, from  a legal  point  of view, it should  not  matter whether or  not  homosexuals can  “change.”  Enforcing such  a discriminatory mindset upon  deciding rights protection contradicts the  precedent in Brown v. Board of Education.

III. The  sociocultural critique of unequal civil rights for gays The  idea that  immutability is a criterion for rights  protection is a classic example of the law blindly accepting social norms  and  codifying  those   norms   into   decisions   supporting  unequal  rights. In Bowers v. Hardwick, Justice Blackmun  warns against  this trend arguing, “A policy of selective application must be supported by a neutral and  legitimate interest—something more  substantial than a habitual dislike for, or ignorance about,  the  disfavored  group” (Bowers, 478  U.S. 186,  646).  In  fact,  in  Justice  Powell’s words, segregation of civil rights from homosexuals is no better than  racial “animus”  (Bowers, 478 U.S. 186, 1093),  especially because  such  a decision  relies  on  premises  similar  to those  that  blacks suffered when fighting  for civil rights and  violates Blackmun’s  standard of justifying discrimination on  “neutral and  legitimate interests.” Specifically, both  black and  gay experiences of discrimination include  a conflict  between  equal  rights  and  accepted social norms that construct and  label each group as “inferior.”  Although current society and  public  exposure make  it seem  that  homosexuality is acceptable, gays are still labeled  as having “abnormal behavior  […] [and being] in no way […] the moral  equivalent of heterosexuals” (Fone 411).
This assumption spills over into  how society and  the  law treat homosexuals. In Justice White’s concurring opinion in Bowers v. Hardwick, he even argues that the current “majority sentiment about the  morality  of homosexuality” was acceptable, and  subsequently accepts the current discriminatory point  of view about  gays (Bowers,
478 U.S. 186, 1090). This is similar to courts’  prior  acceptance of Jim Crow laws, laws banning interracial marriage and  the “Defense of Marriage  Act” (Fone 414) as these  laws were intended to keep blacks from questioning and challenging the current social hierarchy of rights and  social status. In most case law, such as Brown v. Board of Education, a dominant discriminating group seldom agrees  with  arguments that  challenge its  hierarchy of  rights: arguments which  challenge distinctions between  itself and  the target  group. For example, in segregation, “African Americans  had to be kept in their  place, one that was inferior to and separate from whites” (Cox  2).  In  fact, this  is one  main  reason  why there was strong  social opposition to desegregation: equal  education gave African Americans  an opportunity to disprove social stereotypes and to have access to create  social reform.
The  exact same attitude is taken  to prevent  gays from  having anti-discrimination laws and  marriage rights.  As Richard  Mohr explains,  the  marriage issue is not  one  of legal justifiability; it a dangerous stepping stone  to legitimizing  status  quo  distinctions between  heterosexuals and homosexuals (not unlike  those between blacks and  whites). The  idea of limiting  marriage rights to heterosexual  couples  is “circular,  lacks any merit  and  explains  nothing […]  Its function is to assure heterosexual supremacy as a central cultural form” (Cox  4). In other words, giving homosexuals marriage rights and  other civil liberties  endangers social assumptions about  the  immorality  of homosexual relationships, just as equal educational opportunity endangered common views about  blacks. Professor  Sylvia Law agrees, arguing that “when homosexual people build  relationships of  caring  and  commitment, they  deny  the traditional belief and  prescription that  stable relations require the hierarchy and  reciprocity of male/female polarity” (Cox 5). Therefore, just as the court  understood the social implications of preventing equal  opportunity to education, there is a substantial legal reason  to act similarly for homosexual couples:  relying  on  social norms  such as immutability and  the arguments made  to justify “gay inferiority”  is inappropriate in civil rights  law.

IV. An analysis using critical postmodernism and positivism to show similarities between race and sexual orientation discrimination.
Both blacks and homosexuals share  similar experiences of discrimination  as  both   groups   react   similarly  to  their   labeling   as  a “deviant  subpopulation” (Rhoads 26). Critical  postmodernism is a  framework  of  ideas  premised on  the  assumption that  social expectations are formed from a combination of language, culture, and power in society. Postmodernism explains  how minority  groups are often  treated as outcasts in society because  of their  lack of power and  because  of differences such as race and  sexual orientation. For example, both  blacks and  homosexuals respond to social rejection by uniting and forming  nationalist groups.  While blacks formed the ideas of black nationalism via the “Black Power” movement and  the Black  Panthers,  homosexuals  have  formed  “queer   alliances” and  the  “Pink Panthers” in their  crusade for equal  rights  (16). Critical  postmodernism argues  that  such unification is natural as ostracized  groups  desire  to find an identity  in their  unified  groups, especially when  mainstream society rejects  them.
How does this relate  to the law? Well, it describes  the common trend in law in the  areas  of both  black  civil rights  and  gay civil rights, in Rhoads’ phrase, “the norm  [that] becomes  the prescribed code  that  societal members must follow” (28).  Essentially, the  law uses positivistic ideas  (lessons  from  science  and  empiricism) to justify discriminatory practice, just as books such as the  Bell Cur ve and  movies such  as Bir th of a Nation were used  to prevent  black equality. Similarly, ideas like ‘immutability’  and studies that establish that  homosexuals are  not  as “rational”  as heterosexuals all are positivist constructions (interpretations,  inventions) that  equally and  arbitrarily  undermine claims to protection under the  Equal Protection Clause.  This  specific  mode  of attack  is what Michel Foucault  calls “normalization”: for blacks, the idea of the white male is normalized as the  ideal  person, while blacks are  marginalized as a “deviant  subpopulation” who  are  naturally  inferior, weak, morally  corrupt and  therefore undeserving of rights  protection (qtd.  in Rhoads  28). When  applying  Foucault’s  normalization to the  current conflict  over gay civil rights,  the  histories  of discrimination for both  groups  are identical. In Boy Scouts v. Dale (2000), the  court  accepted the  Boy Scouts’ contention that,  despite  Dale’s twelve years of experience as a proven  leader  and  Eagle Scout, he was not “morally straight”  and  “clean,” terms used to described the “normal,  heterosexual male  lifestyle.”  In  Bowers, Justice White similarly  accepts   the  contention  that   homosexual conduct  is immoral. In both  cases, because  homosexuals (like  blacks)  are  a marginalized group that  didn’t  fit the social norm, society and  the law refuse  them  equal  protection and  label  them  as an  outcast group.  Therefore,  from  a  cultural postmodern  view, the  gay experience of discrimination is virtually identical to  the  black experience: under both  experiences, the  victims are marginalized and  assumed  to be inferior and  morally weak; under both  experiences the law and  the Supreme Court  have accepted those  contentions   with  little   evidence   because   of  the   groups’   respective “deviant subpopulation” role in society. This means  that homosexuals have a legal claim that  their  prejudice fits the  first criterion of analogy  to the  African-American  experience of discrimination.

V.   Psychological harm  as a justification for equal protection.
Finally, the  last criterion required by the  14th amendment is that homosexual civil rights must be either fundamental rights or that homosexuals must be politically powerless to change their  situation. This paper will not  deal  with the  second  standard; however,  it is sufficient  (as per  the  tests for strict scrutiny)  to prove  that  denying homosexuals civil rights violates crucial  fundamental rights as human beings. First, note  that Brown v. Board of Education establishes that   social   and   psychological    harm    is  a   possible   standard to  warrant  protection by the  Equal  Protection Clause.  Justice Warren,  in  his  concurring opinion, explains  that  the  right  to education should  be protected because  it is “the foundation of good citizenship and  the  basis for professional training and  adjustment to society” (Stone 635). Therefore, all that  must be established is that gay civil rights are essential  to their  good citizenship and status as productive members of society.
There are two reasons  why gay civil rights meet  this standard. First, allowing discrimination based  on  sexual orientation or the disclosure  there of causes  serious  psychological  damage, on  par with what  black  children suffered  because  of segregation. For homosexual children, there is a development process  for forming a “healthy  homosexual identity”: innocence, a feeling  of shame,  a need  to confess one’s sexual orientation, and finally self-acceptance. The  crucial  step  is confession  or disclosure, because  that  allows homosexual children (and adults)  to create  inter-personal relationships (both romantic and  platonic) and  to find  a support system with other groups  (Shawver  71-77). Legal acceptance of anti-gay laws such as “don’t  ask, don’t  tell” and  sexual orientation discrimination deter  all homosexuals from  the  psychologically  necessary stage of disclosure  by allowing society to take away civil rights, jobs, and  other basic opportunities by engaging in this psychologically natural process.  Because  it may take  years or even a few decades to realize one’s sexual orientation, this impacts  all people because it deters  anyone  from feeling  secure  in their  civil rights and  standing within society. This psychological  harm  is, in magnitude, on par with Justice Warren’s  conception of education as a fundamental right.  Because the right  to disclose one’s sexual identity  is so closely linked  to emotional growth  and  the  formation of self-esteem,  it follows that  refusing  to protect sexual orientation under the Equal Protection Clause is similar to allowing African American  children to suffer socially, without  any legal protection.

VI.  Burden of proof
It   is  crucial   to   note   the   premise  of   arguments  in   recent Supreme Court  case law denying  homosexuals full protection under the Equal Protection Clause: that  gays must prove without  a doubt that  their   experience is synonymous  to  the  African-American experience. However, as many of the  previously mentioned issues are ambiguous and  debatable, meeting such a burden is difficult. Issues such as immutability can be claimed  both  ways, from arguing that  it is possible  to “hide” homosexual tendencies to claims that homosexuality is genetically  based and  therefore innate and  immutable.  Because of this ambiguity,  the  Supreme Court  has, in cases like Bowers, made  subjective  assumptions about  the  truth of such claims—and usually, the Court agrees with appeals that deny homosexuals equal rights.   They defer  to social pressures  to say that gays are “immoral”  and  “different.”  However, one  should  question the  legitimacy  of readily  accepting cases like Bowers as proof  that homosexuals fail the  three criteria  for protection because  of the inherent subjectivity in the  Court’s past rulings  on the  issue. The law should  probably  assume that  because  gays can make  scientific or social claims that  establish  that  they can make  a case that  their situation is similar  should  be sufficient  to pass the  three criteria. In other words, because  gays can make  a case that  there are ways to prove that they are politically powerless or immutable, we should either reject  these  questionable criteria  or assume that  they meet these  criteria  because  the  courts  will have to make  a subjective interpretation either way. The  worst case scenario  is for the  courts to deny rights to homosexuals because  of an assumption about  the nature of their  discrimination. The  logic is the  same for criminal defendants; they are not imprisoned unless their  crimes are proven “beyond  a  reasonable doubt,”   so  if the  state  fails  to  meet  its burden of proof  to  show convincingly  that  gays fail one  of the criteria,  the powerless person should  be protected. Therefore, the courts  should  reevaluate how it has given homosexuals the burden of proof  in this issue.

VII. Conclusion
In sum,  the  case for protecting gay civil rights  under the  Equal Protection Clause requires that the Court  challenges the legitimacy of current unquestioned assumptions about  homosexuality, assumptions  that  parallel  those  posed  against  African Americans.
The  black and  gay experiences of discrimination are  synonymous because  both  experiences have included victimization  from the law, from social marginalization and  violence in society. Immutability is unacceptable as a criterion for distinguishing between  the two groups  because  it as a standard reinforces the  social mindset that  people are  inferior and  weak: it  fails to  be  neutral in  its application to gay civil rights,  which undermines the  decision  in Brown v. Board. Finally, despite  the  Court’s  decision  in Bowers v. Hardwick, the  right  to be homosexual and  to express  that  identity to others  is a fundamental right  because  it is necessary for psychological growth,  just as equal  desegregated education was essential for African-American  children. Despite their  differences, blacks and homosexuals have structurally relevant  similarities  that justify “strict scrutiny” for both  groups  and  a new realization that  just as W. E. B. Dubois coined  that  we should  reject  the  “color line,” we should now reject  the  line  that  the  Supreme Court  and  legal precedent have drawn—that if you are  homosexual, you no  longer deserve human, social, or legal rights.
