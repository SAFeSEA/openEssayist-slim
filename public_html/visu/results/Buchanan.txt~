The Birth of the Political Conscience

by Katherine Buchanan




























Just last March, Democrats and Republicans were busy hammering out a compromise over minimum wage.   Democrats bemoaned the disparity between wages and worker productivity gains, while Republicans predicted devastating job losses if the proposed increase weren’t balanced by substantial tax cuts (Galvin 1). In the end, Congress passed a bill to increase the minimum wage by one dollar over the course of two years, as well as a measure to decrease the estate tax and boost contribution limits on 401K’s. Whether or not they realized it, the participants in this partisan debate were continuing the historical dialogue on liberty.   This time, the estate tax reduction represented the view that government’s primary aim is protection of property, and the increase in minimum wage corresponded to the theory that government exists not merely to protect property, but to increase the quality of its citizens’ lives as well.  In essence, we saw John Locke and John Stuart Mill going head to head on the Senate floor.
America acknowledges its philosophical debts to both Locke and Mill, and the integration of their respective opinions in modern legislation attests to the authors’ similarities.  It would be oversimplification, however, to claim as one historian did, that “the classical argument for tolerance formulated by John Milton and John Locke” was simply “restated by John Stuart Mill” (Hamburger 91). Although Locke and Mill reached similar conclusions on the boundary between individual and societal rights, and  both  espoused  tolerance  and  individualism,  their  methodology  in  justifying
minimal government restrictions on personal liberty rested on very different philosophical bases.  Locke traced liberty to its genesis in the State of Nature, man’s so called Natural Rights therein, and the Social Contract, whereas Mill abandoned these abstract historical arguments in favor of utilitarianism.   Before hastily juxtaposing Mill’s theory with Locke’s, we must account for the particular historical circumstance that gave rise to each.  Only then can we begin to contrast the theories and their subsequent applications.
With careful scrutiny, a Hegelian dialectic can be traced from Locke to Mill. When Locke penned his Second Treatise of Government ca. 1683, he wrote against the prevailing attitude that the distribution of goods should be subject to community controls.   Largely a remnant of feudalism, this 16th and 17th century economic system allowed the monarch to set prices for the supposed “good of all” (Lougee, Locke and Enlightenment, 1/23/01).  Laws of supply and demand were ignored, and special interests often corrupted market values (Lougee, Locke and Enlightenment, 1/23/01).  Additionally, society held it unfair for persons to acquire more property than met their immediate needs. With his radical concept of property as a paramount right and the Labor Theory of Value, Locke presented the rough antithesis to these conventions.  Citing the creation of money, Locke refuted the notion that property could be limited and thus established some of the groundwork for pure capitalism (Locke 29).  The rising empiricism and Enlightenment that characterized the 17th c. enabled him intellectually; the political world had started to purge itself of religious overtones, and Locke emulated the minds of the Scientific Revolution.  The Duke of Shaftesbury, Locke’s mentor, advocated laissez faire economics, and in time Locke came to share his view (Lougee, Locke and Enlightenment, 1/23/01).   Locke’s analysis, then, was highly quantitative as compared to the subjectivity that characterized economics before the Enlightenment.
But evolution was far from complete. In fact, by the time Mill wrote On Liberty in 1859, the dialectic was primed for synthesis.   Integrating some components of control with laissez faire, Mill’s economic system reflected 19th century Romanticism in its qualitative nature. The failure of the 1848 Frankfurt Convention’s liberal constitution indicated a growing dissatisfaction with the pure capitalism that Locke had articulated, and liberalism by its association with capitalism, had come to be viewed as a narrow, bourgeoisie value system.  If liberalism wanted to survive, it needed to expand its support base by broadening its social agenda (Lougee, 1848 and the Crisis of Liberalism, 2/20/01).   Individuals were discovering that total Enlightenment rationalism could be spiritually unsatisfying; Mill’s nervous breakdown in spite of his academic achievements, exemplifies this pitfall. Following his personal crisis, Mill turned to art and love in addition to logic, a concept reflected in his economic system. While Mill accepted economic laws as dry and unchallengeable maxims, he also believed that the distribution of wealth could and should be manipulated by the community. This time, however, no single ruler would fix prices; balance depended on an active citizenry.   Ethics and morality, but not necessarily religion, possessed the right to curb monopolies and impose a graduated income tax in order to secure the greatest good for the greatest number (Lougee, 1848 and the Crisis of Liberalism, 2/20/01).  Mill added one corollary to this essentially Benthamite premise:  the good was to be measured “both in point of quantity and quality” (Mill 150).   Thus, Mill represents a special brand of utilitarianism, the philosophical premise that will take us to the crux of the underlying difference between his philosophy and Locke’s.
First, let us begin with the basic premise: did Locke and Mill share one definition of liberty?  “Liberty,” wrote Locke, “is the power a man has to do or forbear doing any particular action according as its doing or forbearance has the actual preference in the mind, which is the same thing as to say, according as he himself wills it” (Locke qtd. in Yaffe 14).  On this point, Mill practically paraphrases Locke:  “Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign” (13).  But Mill delineates liberty further than Locke did. In addition to “liberty of thought and feeling; absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects” and “liberty of tastes and pursuits,” Mill claims another dimension: “from this liberty of the individual, follows the liberty, within the same limits, of combination among individuals” (Mill 15-16). Although Mill’s definition is more explicit and more thoroughly developed than Locke’s, it is still reasonable to assert that the three components Mill delineates are all actually embedded in Locke’s more succinct definition.  Locke and Mill agree, then, on what liberty is, but disagree on liberty’s origin.
Locke fundamentally believed that “to understand political power right, and derive it from its original, we must consider, what state all men are naturally in and that is, a state of perfect freedom” (8).  Further, “The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every one” (9).   Under these assumptions, all contemporary political rights can be traced to natural rights, and all municipal laws “are only so far right, as they are founded on the law of nature, by which they are to be regulated and interpreted” (12).   Mill contemptuously dismissed this notion, stating in On Liberty, “It is proper to state that I forgo any advantage which could be derived to my argument from the idea of abstract right as a thing independent of utility.  I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions” (14).  Critics attacked this clearly non-Lockean but rather hastily made comment, prompting Mill to defend it in his later work, Utilitarianism (1863).  In that essay Mill summarized his philosophy as follows:  “Utility or the Greatest Happiness Principle, holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness” (144).  This utility — not a prehistoric state of nature — was “the directive rule of human conduct” (149). Furthermore, rights were based on “no other reason than general utility” (199).  “That a feeling is bestowed on us by Nature, does not necessarily legitimize all its promptings,” Mill wrote, directly contradicting his predecessor (185).   While Mill was ready to concede that men naturally love freedom, power, and excitement, and that all men possess some measure of dignity (147), he stopped short of suggesting that these facets of human nature were in any way cumulative. Locke’s reasoning rests on the premise that each successive generation of men builds on human nature, that man inherits a sort of collective consciousness concerning his natural rights and that “all men are naturally in that state...till by their own consents they make themselves members of some politic society” (14).  Mill intimates that men are at least partially constructed by the societies into which they are born, and therefore cannot possibly make an objective decision as to whether or not to join that society.  In turn, this leads Mill to reject the Social Contract, an essential part of Locke’s original argument.
Locke alleged that the state of nature often degenerated into the state of war, a state of perpetual danger and unease.   Therefore, as recourse to justice, men put “themselves into society” and quit the state of nature (Locke 16); however, if anyone violated this primordial compact by attempting to exercise absolute power over the life, liberty, or property of another, he forfeited his own power and rights (Locke 111). Without this conception of the Social Contract, Locke could not have justified revolution.  Yet, Mill faults Locke’s reasoning, denouncing the Social Contract as a “favorite contrivance,” a “fiction of a contract whereby at some unknown period all the members of society engaged to obey the laws and consented to be punished for any disobedience” (201). “Even if the consent were not a mere fiction,” Mill writes, “this maxim is not superior in authority to others which it is brought in to supercede. It is, on the contrary, an instructive specimen of the loose and irregular manner in which supposed principles of justice grow up” (202). Historical context best explains why Mill takes issue with Locke on this particular point; Locke wrote his Second Treatise of Government to vindicate a specific historical cause, namely, the exclusion of the Catholic James II from the English crown (Lougee, Locke and Enlightenment 1/23/01).  When Mill wrote nearly two centuries later, both the American and the French Revolutions had affirmed a people’s right to revolution, so in a sense this right had come to be regarded as self-evident, no longer warranting defense.   Mill’s statements about societal obligations, so similar to Locke’s, obscure Mill’s exact argument  against  the  Social  Contract.    Elsewhere  in  Utilitarianism  he  writes, “Though society is not founded on a contract and though no good purpose is answered by inventing a contract in order to deduce social obligations from it, everyone who receives the protection of society owes it a return for the benefit” (86). As we are about to discover, Mill and Locke ultimately concur on what some of these returns are.
Thus far, we have focused on the distinguishing characteristics of Locke and Mill, especially their philosophical bases for the origin of liberty.   While these differences are authentic and compelling, it is important not to let them overshadow the fact that in practice Locke and Mill’s philosophies are strikingly similar. Therefore, our attention now shifts to the implications of theory. In the final analysis both Locke and Mill aimed at the same target:   the best possible state of human existence.  This is what Locke deemed  “the good of mankind” (115), and what Mill described as “an existence exempt as far as possible from pain and as rich as possible in enjoyments” (150).     Locke and Mill concluded that this fundamental goal of maximizing happiness/good could best be achieved indirectly, based on the adoption of certain principles like free agency, and without direct appeals to happiness.  Both grasped the principle that direct appeals are self-defeating, insofar as men are fallible to their own biases.  Locke noted this human fallibility on page 12 of his Second Treatise of Government: “It is unreasonable for men to be judges in their own cases, that self-love will make men partial to themselves and their friends,” just as Mill noted in On Liberty that men’s opinions, “are affected by all the multifarious causes which influence their wishes in regard to the conduct of others...their legitimate or illegitimate self-interest” (9).  Therefore, Mill refers decisions to “social utility” as represented through government (203), an entity that Locke saw fit to “restrain the impartiality and violence of men” (Locke 12).  The government’s right to intervene as arbiter between self-interested citizens is what Mill calls “civil or societal liberty.” While this is a vital check on individuals, both Locke and Mill take every measure to ensure that societal liberty never oversteps its bounds.
According to Locke, liberty under government consists of the “liberty to follow my own will in all things, where the rule prescribes not” (17). Moreover, as each man is bound to preserve his own life, he also ought to “preserve the rest of mankind” so long as doing so does not call his own preservation into competition (Locke 9).  Mill shares exactly the same sentiments: “The only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs” (16).  And, like Locke, Mill believes that individuals ought to aid one another as much as possible; in fact, he asserts that one individual could legitimately be compelled to save another’s life in situations of immediate danger or to perform various other actions for the general good, such as testifying in a court of law (Mill 14).  Since all men are entitled to free agency, it can only follow that no individual among them can attempt to interfere with how any other individual chooses to exercise his right.  One individual may find another’s conduct offensive, in which case Mill says he can justifiably avoid the offending individual (89), but he still has no legitimate reason to curtail the offensive behavior.  This is the common doctrine of tolerance that both Locke and Mill propagate.
When it comes to punishment, both Locke and Mill make it painstakingly evident that intervention is a last resort, to be used only when an individual oversteps his own liberty and violates someone else’s.  “The sole end for which mankind are warranted individually or collectively in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection,” Mill wrote in On Liberty; his argument for self- defense recapitulates Locke’s in generally less explosive terminology (Mill 12). Locke’s strong theological stance, due more to historical context than anything else, manifests itself in phrases like “state of war” and “for the same reason he may kill a wolf or a lion” (15).   Mill shies away from these unrefined terms as they are so closely allied with a brutish state of nature, and Mill would never have used a direct quote from the Bible (“Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed” (Locke 12)) to justify retribution.  This is a minor stylistic difference between the authors, yet it constitutes some of the only textual evidence of how Locke and Mill’s different underlying philosophies affect applications of theory.
Taken on the whole, however, the punishment issue illuminates a strong link between Locke and Mill. Invading another’s right to life, liberty, health or property makes one “highly guilty of the greatest crime” (Locke 116), and is punishable by “moral reprobation and in grave cases, moral retribution and punishment” (Mill 90). Mill cites two distinct forms of punishment in On Liberty: legal penalty and unofficial public censorship (Mill 14). Likewise, Locke categorized punishment into two distinct parts, reparation and restraint.  Reparation consists of the injured party’s right to seek compensation for any loss, and restraint refers to society’s right as a whole to make the offender “repent” of his misdeeds (Locke 10).  A perfect one-to- one correlation does not exist between legal penalty and reparation or public censorship and restraint, but nevertheless, these categories indicate the similar systematic ways in which Locke and Mill approached punishment.
One final aspect related to government intervention merits exploration: enforced equality, a kind of economic punishment, per se.  In this case, Mill’s utilitarianism should in no way be confused with utopianism, for despite his convictions about the greatest good for the greatest number, Mill did not believe that total enforced equality was the end-all panacea leading to ultimate good. In fact, Mill anticipated stagnation if bad workmen received the same wages as good workmen (101). Mill’s justification of  inequality  draws  its  strongest  arguments  from  none  other  than  John  Locke. Locke’s Labor Theory of Value, or the idea that all men possess the property of their person and that “whatever he hath mixed his labor with makes it his property” (Locke 19), underwrites Mill’s later proposition that “different persons should be allowed to lead different lives” (Mill 73).  Furthermore, it provides the basis for Mill’s counter- argument to the allegation that allowing some men to supercede others in an overcrowded profession went against utilitarianism since the winners would benefit from others’ disappointment. “It is, by common admission better for the general interest of mankind that persons should pursue their objects undeterred by this sort of consequence,” Mill proclaimed, clearly orating from the platform that Locke had provided (Mill 109).
In Mill’s work we see the fusion of pure capitalism and social obligation, the birth of a political conscience.   Mill realized that in writing about the struggle between liberty and authority, he was adding his voice to a discussion that could be traced “almost from the remotest ages” (Mill 3). John Locke, as one of the most articulate participants in the dialogue, impacted Mill who alludes to Locke’s early accomplishment of obtaining recognition of political rights and the right to revolution (Mill 4). But because Mill believed in the fluidity of ideas, he was not afraid to depart from Locke’s formidably established philosophical basis and raise his own voice. Overall, despite his utilitarian convictions, Mill retained the Lockean premises that suited him, such as the Labor Theory of Value, finally reaching similar conclusions about the proper balance between personal and societal liberty. Thus, his contribution helped shaped the dialogue on liberty, and as the contemporary minimum wage debate proves, both Mill’s and Locke’s voice continues to echo today.  Our society may be a far cry from what either Locke or Mill envisioned, but this only goes to show that “ages are no more infallible than individuals...it is as certain that many opinions now general, will be rejected by future ages, as it is that many once general are rejected by the present” (Mill 23).  In our quest for personal and governmental harmony, the conscience continues to assert itself, and we move, by trial and error towards perfection of positive liberty.
